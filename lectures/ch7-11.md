# 7 - Transport Layer
### Distance Vector Algorithm
- exchange info with direct neighbours to determine shortest path in a network
- iterative process that coverges slowly
- c(x, y) = cost of __LINK__ from x to y. infinity if not direct neighbours
- dx(y) = least cost from x to y, out of all paths and all links
- calculated by bellman ford
- Implemented by __RIP: Routing Information Protocol__

### Network Address Translation (NAT)
- private IPs can't be routed on the public network
- hence, we must translate all private IPs (and port number) into public (typically the router's IP)
  - needs to implement port number, as port numbers may not be unique, everyone may use 8080
- uses a NAT table

### Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- Used for troubleshooting
- Variables error codes
- Popular uses: __ping__, __traceroute__

# 8 - Network Security
__Confidentiality__: prevent eavesdropping  
__Integrity__: prevent modification  
__Authenticity__: prevent spoofing  

### Encryption
- A send to B, A can use an encryption key to encrypt, and B can use a decryption key to decrypt
- ciphertext is in the middle, and everyone else will only hear ciphertext
- it would be hard to dtermine message without knowing the decryption key
- In cryptography, algorthim is known, but key is secret
- Symmetric and Public key

#### Symmetric Key Cryptography
- A key __K_a-b__ is used by both encryption and decryption
  - typically using AES (advanced encryption standard), and previously using DES
  - the AES key is some form of manifestation of the password (<= 256bit length)
- Mono-alphabetic cipher - every alphabet replaced
- How do they communicate the key? The password is typically sent in a different channel to be safe. However, in network transmission, it is not safe to send over the key somewhere

#### Public Key Cryptography
- Public key is known to everyone, but private key is only known to receiver
- A will use public key to encrypt, and private key is used for decryption
- K^-(K^+(m)) == m == K^+(K^-(m))
- Most popular: RSA (Rivest, Shamir, ...)
  - public key is product of 2 large primes
  - private key is derived from these 2 primes

#### Session Key
- RSA is used to send symmetric key (session key) to other party
- Then, from then on, the session key is used instead

### Integrity and Authentication
Message Authentication Code (MAC) or Digital Signature

### Hash Function
- From m, generate H(m), a message digest
- Popular modes: MD5, SHA-1
- It is computationally infeasible to find m' for m, where H(m) == H(m')
  - Therefore, if a message is ever modified, the hash would almost definitely be different

### Authentication Key for MAC
- if A sends to B a message with a shared key, then B takes the message + his own key should = hash
  - in other words, the hash can only be regenerated if sender has the shared key

### Digital Signature
- a verifiable signature, where a 3rd party knows who it belongs to, and cannot be denied
- we use a digital signature based on the private key of the sender
- by sending both m and k^-(m), receiver than verify that sender sent the message


# 9 - Link Layer
Link layer refers to every individual hop in the network. A packet may require multiple hops to get to destination

__Frames__ encapsulate IP Datagrams using a header and/or trailer. At every hop, the header and trailer may change

### Implementation
- Using an adaptor, or a chip. These adaptors typically implement both link and physical layer

### Error Detection/Correction
- CRC (better but slower) vs Parity Checking (faster)
  - in reality, CRC is implemented into the hardware, making it fast
- __Parity Checking__
  - single bit: add all together, sum is the parity bit
  - two dimensional: every row and column, and add all sums and columns together. whole matrix is sent to receiver. 4 bit errors may be missed. 1 bit may be even corrected
_ __Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)__: better used, as linked layer was previously very error prone
  - 99.999% reliability
  - D: data bits (binary number), G: generator (r+1), R: r bit result
  - R = D/G - some form of binary division(XOR), read slides
  - To verify, divide (D, R) / G => remainder should be 0

### Access Control for Multiple Link
- Two types of links: point to point link and broadcast link
- __Point to point link__ a dedicated link between 2 devices
  - no contention of link, no need for multiple access control
  - half duplex
- __broadcast link__: multiple people share 1 link, so there must be some control
  - e.g. wifi, satellite, ethernet with bus topology
  - if collide, frames may collide, and if they do, none would be read correctly


- __Channel partitioning__: divide channel into small pieces, and each piece is exclusively used
  - TDMA: time division multiple access
    - time is divided into small pieces, and at every time slot, only a dedicated person can transmit
  - FDMA: frequency division multiple access [e.g. radio]
- __Taking turns__: nodes take turns to transmit
  - polling: master will invite slaves to transmit in turn (basically "do you have data to send?" w/ max time and completion flag)
    - efficient with low load, fair with high load
    - but high overhead (1 RTT for each invitation), and single point of failure (master node)
  - token passing: a token is passed around, network is organized as a ring
    - performance is okay, but token is an overhead, and token may disappear
- __Random access__: detect and recover from collision
  - __Slotted Aloha__: frames of equal size, time of equal length, nodes only transmit at the beginning of a slot
    - try to transmit at the beginning of a slot. if collision happens, we try to transmit with probability p at the next timeslot
    - 37% utility for transmission
  - __Pure Aloha__: even higher chance to collide, as it is not slotted. 20% utilization
  - __Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)__: check if channel is busy, if not, transmit, else wait
    - both check and realize free, both transmit => still will collide.
    - chance is still high due to propagation delay!

# 10 - Link Layer continued
### CSMA Collisions
- collision is very possible due to propagation delays
- it will also finish transmitting even when collision happened

### CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)
- Quickly abort when collision detected. shorten time wasted
- However, if frame size is small, both would not detect collision, although it will collide
  - minimum frame size (64 bytes for ethernet)

### CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)
- Receiver will ACK if frame is received OK (or NAK if not received)

# Local Area Network

### MAC Address
- Implemented in every adaptor/network interface card
- Also known as physical address, hardware address
- Hardware will check destination with its own, if it's not the same, it will discard
- Every NIC has a unique MAC address! A computer may have >1 NIC

### Address Resolution Protocol: ARP
- Every IP node (host/router) has an ARP table: <IP Address, MAC Address, TTL>
- Stores the IP and MAC of all other nodes in the same subnet
- If A wants to send to B, A will use B's MAC from ARP table to send to B
- If A does not know B's address, it will send a query packet containing B's IP to FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF, which only B will reply (to A's MAC Address)
- If B is not in the same subnet, A will send to ROUTER's MAC, which will forward to B through other links

### Ethernet
- same frame format, and same MAC (CSMA/CD)
- Bus/Star topology (more popular)
- Frame min length of 64 bytes: 18 bytes header/trailer + 46 min bytes data
  - 6 byte src mac address, 6 byte dest mac address, 2 byte type (IP), 4 byte CRC
  - also has 8 bytes preamble to synchronize clock speed in signals
  - connectionless (like every other except TCP) so unreliable

### Bus Topology
- Collision may happen v frequently, which requires resending
- Uses CSMA/CD algorithm. It checks channel, if free, transmit
  - During transmission, it checks channel to detect collision
  - Once detected, abort and send jam signal
  - After m^th collision, it chooses a k from 0 to (2^m)-1 [total chance 2^m], and waits m*512 bit times before sending again
  - many adaptors limit m to 16, before reporting to higher level system

### Switches
- Link layer device to forward frame
- Examine incoming mac address, and forwards to the right host
- Uses a switch forwarding table: <MAC, interface, TTL>
- Records whenever a packet comes from that host => self learning process
- Only forwards to that host if MAC Address exists in SFT
- Note: switch is not on network layer, router is!

# 11 - Physical Layer
Digital vs Analog Signals
Analog Signals - an EM wave, infinitely many level
Digital Signal - discreet values, limited number

### Digital Transmission
- 1 and 0 at different levels
- __NRZ__: Non-return-to-Zero
  - NRZ-L: positive to represent 0, negative to represent 1
  - NRZ-I: invert if 1, keep if 0
- __RZ__: Return-to-Zero
  - Halfway through a signal, it will always return to 0 (then use NRZ-L syntax)
  - 3 levels of voltage
- Manchester Code
  - positive to negative halfway - 0
  - negative to positive halfway - 1
  - at full count, switches are not considered as any real signal
  - clock must be synchronized

### Analog Transmission
- bandwidth: difference between highest and lowest frequency of channel
- SNR: signal to noise ratio, and indication of channel quality
- C = B * log_2(1+SNR), where B = bandwidth, and C = channel capacity
- Analog encoding:
  - 0 and 1 can be changed using amp (ASK), freq (FSK) or phase (PSK), * shift keying
- __ASK__: Amplitude Shift Keying
  - High (non-zero) amplitude: 1, zero amplitude, 0
  - Susceptible to noise
- __FSK__: Frequency Shift Keying
  - High Frequency: 1, Low Frequency: 0
  - We can go for >binary. More frequency means more information. However, limited by bandwidth
- __PSK__: Phase Shift Keying
  - 0 phase change: 1, 180 phase change: 0
  - Use 4 different phases to represent 01, 00, 11, 10 [QPSK Constellation Diagram]
  - 8-PSK?
- QAM????? ASK + PSK. 16-QAM. 4 amplitude levels, 8 phases criss cross???
