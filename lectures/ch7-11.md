# 7 - Transport Layer
### Distance Vector Algorithm
- exchange info with direct neighbours to determine shortest path in a network
- iterative process that coverges slowly
- c(x, y) = cost of __LINK__ from x to y. infinity if not direct neighbours
- dx(y) = least cost from x to y, out of all paths and all links
- calculated by bellman ford
- Implemented by __RIP: Routing Information Protocol__

### Netowrk Address Translation (NAT)
- private IPs can't be routed on the public network
- hence, we must translate all private IPs (and port number) into public (typically the router's IP)
  - needs to implement port number, as port numbers may not be unique, everyone may use 8080
- uses a NAT table

### Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- Used for troubleshooting
- Variables error codes
- Popular uses: __ping__, __traceroute__


# 9 - Link Layer
Link layer refers to every individual hop in the network. A packet may require multiple hops to get to destination
__Frames__ encapsulate IP Datagrams using a header and/or trailer. At every hop, the header and trailer may change
